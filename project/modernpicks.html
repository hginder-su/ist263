    <h1>Modern Picks</h1>
    <p>As someone who was an embarrassingly big “Percy Jackson” fan when they were younger, I’ve always loved reading anything that has to do with Greek mythology, so I had really high expectations going into “Circe."  Madeline Miller does an excellent job of making her readers empathize with a notorious villain in Greek mythology (big Elphaba in “Wicked vibes), and when I think of Circe now, I no longer picture the evil witch who turned her male victims into pigs, but as a compassionate, protective, and fierce woman who longs to be loved.<br>
    While Madeline Miller’s books focus on mythology not just limited to female characters, the book is so important to literary culture as we begin to unravel the conniving, manipulative “witch” trope that has been around since the Salem Witch Trials.</p>

    <p>Although “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” by Betty Smith was published in 1943 and could arguably be seen as a classic, it’s the first book I read about a girl going through adolescence that didn’t feel especially antiquated to me, so I’ve placed it in this category. At its core, the book is a coming of age tale — one that many girls can relate to.. It reminds me of “Lady Bird” in the sense that the main character, Francie Nolan, is idealistic, sensitive, and at times, a little dramatic (but then again, aren't we all?).<br>
    While Francie deals with big issues, the book also documents the simple joys in life and heartaches of growing up. Betty Smith legitimized the drama of the teenage girl experience in the 1900s as Taylor Swift does in the 21st century, and the writing is just so lovely that even the simplest of sentences and anecdotes brought me to tears.</p>

    <p>Critics have credited Sally Rooney with being one of the most prominent writers of the decade and I would have to agree with them. I haven’t read many authors who have written about female friendship and conversations beyond the depths of talking about boy problems and clothes, but Sally Rooney is the exception with "Beautiful World, Where Are You?".<br>
    While the two female leads in her book, Alice and Eileen, do not always act as admirable role models, they’re realistic depictions of all the complexities and questions that come with being a 20-something woman in the 21st century. Alice and Eileen fight with each other, they make poor decisions, and they have grand conversations about communism, the end of the world, mental health, etc.</p>
