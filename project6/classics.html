    <p>Virginia Woolf is simultaneously one of my favorite and least favorite authors. Her writing is beautiful, frustrating, and emotional all at once and this certainly is true for her novel, “To the Lighthouse.” Although “To the Lighthouse” is not about one specific female protagonist, it does feature one of my favorite female characters in literature, Lily Brooks.<br><br>

    Woolf not only redefined the structure of novels, but she’s also so exceptional for her vulnerability when writing about mental health (which she notably with in her personal life). Lily often talks about the pain and anxiety that comes with creating something you care about, while simultaneously refuting efforts from others to find a husband. Although now the idea of a woman focusing on her career instead of marriage isn’t so groundbreaking, Woolf eloquently describes the internal monologue of someone who is so dedicated to their work, that it can be even more heartbreaking than a lost love or failed relationship.</p>

   <p> We all know Louisa May Alcott, and we all know “Little Women." <br><br>

    Although the book was published in 1868, it has transcended through time so seamlessly. The book is autobiographical, with the independent and spirited Jo March taking after Louisa May Alcott, and her ambition is reflected in many powerful female figures today. However, “Little Women” also gives a voice and importance to women who may be on the quieter side like Beth, and women who can at times be a little bit bratty (but still lovable) like Amy, and the women who are caretakers and the rocks of the family like Meg. “Little Women” showed the media that the everyday lives of women, no matter how unexceptional they may seem, mean something to readers and that they’re worth sharing, making Louisa May Alcott’s book one of the most important of all time.</p>

   <p>I vividly remember when I read “Pride and Prejudice” for the first time in 3rd grade (albeit a simplified version for little kids) and immediately thinking that Elizabeth Bennett was the coolest person to ever exist. Over a decade (and too many viewings of the Keira Knightley “Pride and Prejudice” movie to count), later I still feel the same way. Elizabeth Bennett, is smart, confident, knows what she wants, and doesn’t take sh*t from anyone, which is exactly why over 200 years after the novel was published, she is still one of the most beloved characters in literature.</p>
